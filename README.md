## Cierra O'Grady's Creative Exercise
https://creative-exercise-cierrao.glitch.me

I chose to do Canvas. Here are the examples I based my code on:
- https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/canvas_drawing.asp
- https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/canvas_shapes.asp
- https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/canvas_curves.asp
- https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/canvas_gradients.asp
- https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/canvas_text.asp
- https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/canvas_shadows.asp

 I made my code unique from the examples by creating my own polygons, curves, and gradients.
